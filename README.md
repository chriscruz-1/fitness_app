# Welcome to my fitness tracker!
# This is the first personal project that I've deployed with Github pages

Known bugs: 
* View progress button isn't working properly. It is supposed to display a D3 chart with user metrics.
* Reminder of most recent past activity is not showing up. Banner is supposed to appear after website reload.
